Observation of Project:

In reviewing the data set here are a couple of call outs:

Mouse G989 was a duplicate data point that needed to be removed.

The study was well balanced in terms of gender. 


Observations:

Observing the 4 Drugs:

Observation Box Plot: Between the 4 drugs it seems that Capomulin and Ramicane have the best results of the sample size as the final tumor sizes had the lowest mean.  Infubinol did have an outlier that needs to be investigated and is less effective than both Capomulin and Ramicane.

Capomulin overview:

Capomulin is effective as the tumor size decrease over time

Capomulin shows a strong positive coorelation between weight and tumor size.  We can infer that heavier mice may have a correlation to higher tumor size.  We also have a tight R-squared which will state the results having a mininal variation to the mean.

Followups:

A supplemental analysis may be digging further in the Weight vs Tumor Size by mice in the total study.  Reviewing the weight correlation to tumor size will add to the validity of the drug.
